# Welcome to skarard.xyz!

This is the source code for the website skarard.xyz, a website showcasing me and my interests. I'm passionate about a safe and secure Decentralised Society, Racing Quadcopters, and Circus.

## A Safe and Secure Decentralised Society
I believe strongly in the power of decentralised technology to create a society that is out of reach from cruelty and corruption. This is why I'm committed to learning about and developing technology that will enable us to have more trust and transparency in our lives.

## Racing Quadcopters
I'm relatively new to the sport of racing quadcopters, but I'm getting good times in a flight simulator called Lift-Off, and I recently purchased all the gear to fly IRL. I'm excited to see where this hobby takes me!

## Circus
I'm a retired acrobat of 10 years, and I ran a company called Boom Circus Theatre and DuoSu. I've had the pleasure of performing all over the globe doing partner acrobatics.
