# Welcome to skarard.xyz!
This is the source code for the website skarard.xyz, a website showcasing me and my interests. I'm passionate about creating a safe and secure Decentralised Society, pushing the boundaries of Racing Quadcopters, and performing innovative Circus acts.

## A Safe and Secure Decentralised Society
I believe strongly in the power of decentralised technology to create a society that is out of reach from cruelty and corruption. This is why I'm committed to learning about and developing technology that will enable us to have more trust and transparency in our lives.

## Racing Quadcopters
I'm a beginner in the world of racing quadcopters, but I'm honing my skills in a flight simulator called Lift-Off and I recently acquired all the necessary gear to get started in real life. I can't wait to see where this hobby will take me!

## Circus
I'm also a retired acrobat of 10 years, having performed all over the world with my company Boom Circus Theatre and DuoSu. I'm constantly looking for new ways to express my passion for circus and push the boundaries of what's possible. 

This website is also hosted on IPFS and is linked to the ENS domain skarard.eth. Thanks for taking the time to visit my github and learn more about my interests.
